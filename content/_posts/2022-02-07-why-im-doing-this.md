title: Why I am Doing This?

There two main drivers for this blog, first, the internet has given me a lot already, why don't give something back? I've always believed that sharing knowledge is very important to create useful and fun tools, some of these tools might help to create something that could help us in our daily life. Sharing knowledge might enable others to create amazing things. 

Another reason is to create a knowledge repository for me, I would like to document the lesson learned during my working years, I've worked different programming languages, frameworks and tools in order to create amazing software, and I have seen how new technologies have disrupted the way we do software, so I would love to document my journey of learning all these new technologies and maybe one day I might come back and take a look how some problems were solved in the past.
